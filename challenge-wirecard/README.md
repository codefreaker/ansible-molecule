# Test Ansible roles using Molecule
This is the how to guide for deploying devopschallenge.war in a Tomcat container with a self signed SSL Nginx reverse proxy.
# Introduction
There are three roles defined here and they are intended to install OpenJDK,Apache Tomcat, and Nginx. These roles are supposed to work on CenOS 7 as the testing Docker image is CentOs. Further, You may find the self signed certificates in **ansible-role-nginx/files** directory
This has been implemented in [Molecule] (https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) .

# Directory hierarchy for Molecule roles

You can find below molecule roles in **molecule** directory (**challenge/challenge-wirecard/molecule**).

  - **ansible-role-tomcat:** This role installs OpenJDK 1.8 and Apache Tomcat 8. Furthermore, Tomcat  is 			configured to run default  port including systemd service.
  - **ansible-role-nginx:** This installs and configures reverse proxy with self signed SSL. At this moment Nginx version 1.12.2 is availble in the repos and installed.
  - **ansible-role-deployapp:** Deploys the **devopschallenge.war**	into newly build Apache Tomcat instance and restart the service.

# How to run and test Ansible roles

I assume you have installed below tools and applications in your local/desktop server.

## Pre-requisites:

1. Docker in your localhost.
2. Molecule in your localhost. [https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html]
3. Install docker-py using pip.

    ```
     pip install docker-py
    ```    
    
4. git in your localhost.
5. Once you are done with all installations execute below commands sequentially assuming now you are here.
    ``` 
    challenge/challenge-wirecard/molecule 
    ```

## Steps:  

1. Firstly, you have to clone the repository and checkout the **Ansible** branch from BitBucket repo.
    ```
   git clone git@bitbucket.org:codefreaker/challenge.git
   git fetch && git checkout ansible
   git pull
    ```
You can see there are two commands are running for running role task and testing them.
    
   * **molecule check:** Dry run the all actions in the role.
   * **molecule converge:** Run the all tasks written in tasks/main.yml
   * **molecule verify:** Run the testing scripts (molecule/default/ using **testinfra** 

2. Execute below to install and config Tomcat.  
    
    ```
    cd ansible-role-tomcat
    molecule check
    molecule converge
    molecule verify 
    ```
You can see molecule executes all role tasks 

3. Execute below to install and config Nginx with self signed SSL certificate.
    ``` 
    cd ansible-role-nginx
    molecule check
    molecule converge 
    molecule verify          
    ```
4.  This execution will install the application and restart the Tomcat.
    ``` 
    cd ansible-role-tomcat
    molecule check
    molecule converge 
    molecule verify       
    ```

5.  Now you run below command in your host server. 
    ```
    curl -vk https://172.17.0.2 
    ```

    Expected output:
    
```
        
        * About to connect() to 172.17.0.2 port 443 (#0)
        *   Trying 172.17.0.2...
        * Connected to 172.17.0.2 (172.17.0.2) port 443 (#0)
        * Initializing NSS with certpath: sql:/etc/pki/nssdb
        * skipping SSL peer certificate verification
        * SSL connection using TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
        * Server certificate:

        *       issuer: E=kaumina@gmail.com,CN=localhost,OU=DevOps,O=Default Company Ltd,L=Colombo,ST=Western,C=LK
